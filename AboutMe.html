        <p><h1>My start to programming</h1>
            <br/>I first began programming in my junior year of high school back in 2018. My first language I learned was Swift, which is how Apple makes their apps.
            <br/> It was hard at first as I have never coded before, but Swift is more of a layed back language, so learning the basics of coding with that language was nice.
            <br/> After a semester, I took the class again, but I was allowed to develop potential apps for the school. I was able to fully publish one app for the school.
            <br/> <br/> <h3>Final Grade Calculator</h3>
            <br/> With this application, students were able to enter current grades into textboxes and then the app would tell them what grade they would need on the final to pass. 
            <br/>
