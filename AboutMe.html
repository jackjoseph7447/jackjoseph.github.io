          <h3>Getting To Know Me</h3>
          <img id="MeImg" src="images/Me.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
          Hello, my name is John Joseph. I am currently a senior at Temple University studing Information Science and Technology. I grew up right outside of Philadelphia in Delaware County with
          one older sister and two younger brothers. I played a lot of sports when I was a kid, including football, baseball, indoor soccer, and basketball. In high school, I stopped playing football
          and did tech crew for my school's drama club where I built the sets and ran stage crew during the shows. Some shows we did were 9 to 5, James and the Giant Peach, Sherk, and more. This is where 
          I began my coding career and ultimately decided what I wanted to do for a living and career. <br/><br/>

          <h3>My start to programming</h3>
            I first began programming in my junior year of high school back in 2018. My first language I learned was Swift, which is how Apple makes their apps.
            It was hard at first as I have never coded before, but Swift is more of a layed back language, so learning the basics of coding with that language was nice.
            After a semester, I took the class again, but I was allowed to develop potential apps for the school. I was able to fully publish one app for the school and start a second one, which
            was not able to be completed.I then took AP Computer Science the first year it was offered in my high school. This is where I learned my second language, Java. Java was a little more strict that what I already knew,
            so getting used to it took some time, but it was no issue after that. I believe that as long as you know the basics of how to program and what they do, it just learning how each language handles that issue.
            Overall, coding in high school was where I learned the basics of coding, like if statements, functions, and how and where to place certain things within the code. I decided during this time that I wanted to
            do coding as a career, and eventually went to Temple University as a Computer Science major.<br/><br/>
