          <h3>Getting To Know Me</h3>
          <img id="MeImg" src="images/Me.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
          Hello, my name is John Joseph. I am currently a senior at Temple University studing Information Science and Technology. I grew up right outside of Philadelphia in Delaware County with
          one older sister and two younger brothers. I played a lot of sports when I was a kid, including football, baseball, indoor soccer, and basketball. In high school, I stopped playing football
          and did tech crew for my school's drama club where I built the sets and ran stage crew during the shows. Some shows we did were 9 to 5, James and the Giant Peach, Sherk, and more. This is where 
          I began my coding career and ultimately decided what I wanted to do for a living and career. <br/><br/>

          <h3>My start to programming</h3>
            I first began programming in my junior year of high school back in 2018. My first language I learned was Swift, which is how Apple makes their apps.
            It was hard at first as I have never coded before, but Swift is more of a layed back language, so learning the basics of coding with that language was nice.
            After a semester, I took the class again, but I was allowed to develop potential apps for the school. I was able to fully publish one app for the school and start a second one, which
            was not able to be completed.I then took AP Computer Science the first year it was offered in my high school. This is where I learned my second language, Java. Java was a little more strict that what I already knew,
            so getting used to it took some time, but it was no issue after that. I believe that as long as you know the basics of how to program and what they do, it just learning how each language handles that issue.
            Overall, coding in high school was where I learned the basics of coding, like if statements, functions, and how and where to place certain things within the code. I decided during this time that I wanted to
            do coding as a career, and eventually went to Temple University as a Computer Science major.<br/><br/>

          <h3>Coding in College</h3>
            Since I had taken AP Computer Science in high school, I had a general understanding of the basics of coding, which helped me a ton in the beginning stages of my coding classes at Temple University. For all classes up to
            data structures, it was a nice refresher on the code that I may have forgotten. If you would like to see some of those projects, you may view them <a href="https://github.com/jackjoseph7447/JavaCode">here</a>. Also, with these classes, 
            you could have a deeper understanding of how certain things work when code is executed. For example, the different types of lists.
            I had learned about lists in my C class, but not much more than that. Then we learned about arraylist and linkedlists and how they are better for different functionalities. We also had classes on other types of coding, like using SQL 
            to access database information. I loved SQL as it is a very easy language to learn and understand. The first class that was a struggle and really forced learning was Component-Based Software Design.<br/><br/>

            In this class, we would learn the language C#, which is the language I am most familiar with as I have coded in this language for almost two years now. We started with basics, like how a loop is formed, if statements, and arrays. All of these
            were similar to Java, the language we had used up until this class, so the assignments were not that difficult for a little while. After that, however, we started to do more complex coding assignments. In C#, there is the backend part of it, where
            it is C# code itself, but there is the frontend aspect of it too, where you can create GUI for the applications you are creating. Understanding how to get data from the frontend to the backend was sometimes easier said than done.
            The most complex project we had was a web application that was a ordering system. This included using gridviews, sessions, database connections, and C# classes, as we this class also focused on OOP (Object Oreiented Programming).
            We would create custom classes for many things, such as a Car, Students, and other things that could be needed for the certain project. Although we were given a fair amount of time to complete these types of projects, they were a ton of work
            and took a good amount of time not only code everything, but research what needed to be done with an error that would come up. Currently, I am unable to locate any of these coding assignments, but if that changes, I will show examples.<br/><br/>

            Server-Side Web Development and Capstone<br/>
            These classes were two that taught me the most about how coding could go. In Server-Side Web Development (SSWB), we not only learned a great deal of how to code many things while having to manage the time given. Although we were given a fair
            amount of time for these projects, there was a lot that was needed for them. Being able to manage a project, although most of them were solo assignments, is something that will be used for the rest of my career. The two projects where we had a partner,
            Project 4 and 5, was where communitcation with your partner was something that was a requirement. Luckily, I had a great partner where we constantly communicated and were able to do very well on those assignments. Here is a link to a website where
            you can see each project from this class <a href="https://cis-iis2.temple.edu/Fall2023/CIS3342_tul42951/">here</a>. In the capstone, we were in a group of 5, and we had "supervisors" who would be able to help us whenever we needed it.
            Throughout the semester, we worked on a project management tool for the capstone 1 class to help with the organization for those students and professors. There was a ton of communication between our client, the professors, and ourselves. We completed
            many sprints and sprint meetings with our client in order to get the client what they were looking for. I cannot share the project due to the privacy settings on the GitHub repository, however it turned it very well and the client was happy
            with their product.
