            <img id="FGCImages" src="images/MainScreen.png"/>
            <img id="FGCImages" src="images/Tutorial.png"/> <br/>
            With this application, students were able to enter current grades into textboxes and then the app would tell them what grade they would need on the final to pass.
            The first image (The image on the left) is the main screen of the application. It is a very basic layout, but this app was just to get something out there for the students to use,
            it was not really meant to have a complex system. The second image (The image on the right) displays a quick tutorial about how to use the app and what everything means. This is displayed
            by pressing the question mark button in the top left of the screen. If you would like to view the repository for the project, click <a href="https://github.com/jackjoseph7447/FinalGradeApp">here</a>. <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Password Keeper</h3>
            This application was incomplete due to time constrants around when I was having this class, but it was going to be a way that people could store passwords. We were going to use Firebase and some other Google applications,
            but since time was cut short, nothing ever got finished on that project. If you would like to view that repository, click <a href="https://github.com/jackjoseph7447/passwordKeeperV2">here</a>. <br/>
